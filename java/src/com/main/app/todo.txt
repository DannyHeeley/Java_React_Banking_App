The logic for synchronizing objects with the database is spread across several classes,
 such as the AccountManager and DatabaseService classes. It may be beneficial to centralize this logic,
  possibly in the individual model classes (AccountBase, Person, etc.) or in dedicated data access objects.

In DatabaseService, it's not clear how changes to objects are written back to the database.
 A clear strategy for this is crucial for keeping the objects and database in sync.

Concurrency: If the database can be modified by another process while your program is running,
 you'll need to decide how to handle this. You could refresh the object's data from the database regularly,
  or only when you're about to make a change.
- use the synchronized keyword to ensure that only one thread can access a method at a time.
